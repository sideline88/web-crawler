# Development
For development we require Python `3.10.10` to be installed.

```
# Install Python 3.10.10

# Create virtual environment
py -m venv _venv

# Activate the virtual environment (for Windows)
_venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Freeze the requirements.txt file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You should now be working in the local environment. To leave the virtual environment type:

```deactivate```

If the virtual environment has been created and dependencies already installed, the environment only needs to be activated before development can begin.

```
# Activate the virtual environment
_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
